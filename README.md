# Home Value Predictor
Midterm and final project for ECO4444 in Fall 2021, predicts property values from input data in CSV format. It was a pair project, built by me and Cody Olivotto (colivotto@yahoo.com). 

The Python script takes in a training dataset in CSV format, iterates through variable combinations to find a model that best fits the training set, and then saves that model to be used on the test set. Outputs property ID and estimated value in CSV format. 

TODO:
- add instructions for generating a model
- add instructions for using the model that we used in our final presentation
- add descriptors of dataset
- clean up and organize into python and R implementation branches or folders
